symfonylgo
============================

A small logfile splitter on date written in go. Usage:

`symfonylgo logfilename`

Even though you can use `logrotate` to achieve this, or something similar to it, I wanted a quick tool that would easily split my logfiles into files based on their dates.

This is a very raw first version, without any tests. Please create a PR if you'd like to add anything.
